=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use String::Smart;
    my $plain =            "<This is plain text>";
    my $html  = as html => "<p>&lt;This is HTML&gt;</p>";
    
    print as html => $plain, as html => $html;
    # Prints "&lt;This is plain text&gt;<p>&lt;This is HTML&gt;</p>"

    print plain $html;
    # Croaks: "Can't decode markup"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

String::Smart implements overloaded string values that know how they are
currently encoded or escaped and are capapable of transforming
themselves into other encodings.

In many applications it is necessary to apply various escaping rules to
strings before they can safely be used. For example when building a SQL
query string literals must be escaped to avoid SQL injection
vulnerabilities.

Typically this is achieved by SQL escaping all strings that are passed
to the query builder. But what if you pass a string that has already
been SQL escaped? Or a string that is URL encoded? If you wish to pass a
mixture of already-encoded strings and plain string literals you have to
arrange some out of band means of communicating the encoding state of
each string.

With C<String::Smart> you simply make the query building routine
ask for SQL escaped strings and behind the scenes the appropriate
transformations will be applied to each string based on it's
current encoding.

For example:

    my $uri_enc = already uri => 'Spaces+are+evil';
    my $sql_enc = already sql => "\\'Quotes are backslashed\\'";
    my $not_enc =                "Just some literal punctuation: %'+";

    print literal sql => $uri_enc;
    # removes URI encoding
    # applies SQL encoding
    # prints
    #   Spaces are evil

    print literal sql => $sql_enc;
    # already sql encoded
    # prints
    #   \'Quotes are backslashed\'

    print literal sql => $not_enc;
    # applies SQL encoding
    # prints
    #   Just some literal punctuation: %\'+

The important point is that the requested encoding is absolute rather
than relative. A C<String::Smart> knows how it is currently encoded and
can work out how to re-encode itself in the requested way.

=head2 A note on the examples

Throughout the documentation I assume that various encoding
representations (C<sql>, C<html>, C<uri>) have already been defined.
These are not defined by C<String::Smart> and must be set up by calling
C<add_rep> with the appropriate conversion subroutines before the
examples will run.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 C<< add_rep >>

Add an encoding representation. The namespace for encodings is global.
This may turn out to be a problem - and may therefore change.

    add_rep reversed => sub { reverse $_[0] }, sub { reverse $_[0] };
    my $this = "Hello";
    my $that = reversed "Hello";
    print as reversed => $this, "\n";
    # prints "olleH"
    print as reversed => $that, "\n";
    # also prints "olleH"

A representation consists of a name and two subroutine references. The
first subroutine applies the encoding, the second reverses it. If either
subroutine is undefined a boilerplate subroutine that throws a
descriptive error will be used in its place.

=cut

sub add_rep($$$) {
    my ( $name, $to, $from ) = @_;

    croak "$name contains an underscore"
      if $name =~ /_/;

    my %spec = ( from => $from, to => $to );
    for my $dir ( keys %spec ) {
        unless ( defined $spec{$dir} ) {
            $spec{$dir} = sub {
                croak "Don't know how to convert $dir $name";
            };
        }
    }

    $rep_map{$name} = \%spec;
}

=head2 C<< as >>

Coerce a string into the specified encoding.

    my $representation = as html => $some_string;

Optionally multiple encodings my be supplied either like this:

    my $rep = as html_nl2br => $some_string;

Or like this:

    my $rep = as ['html', 'nl2br'], $some_string;

The returned object (actually a hash blessed to C<String::Smart>)
will have the specified encoding irrespective of it's current
encoding. For example the sequence:

    my $html1 = as html => $some_string;
    my $html2 = as html => $html1;

Does I<not> result in double encoding. The encodings you request are
'absolute'. A path of transformations that will convert the string from
whatever its current encoding is will be computed and applied.

=cut

sub as($$) {
    my ( $desired, $str ) = @_;

    my @desired
      = map { split /_/ } 'ARRAY' eq ref $desired ? @$desired : $desired;

    unless ( blessed $str && $str->isa( __PACKAGE__ ) ) {
        $str = bless { val => $str, rep => [] };
    }

    my @got_rep  = $str->rep;
    my @want_rep = @desired;

    # Prune common reps
    while ( @got_rep && @want_rep && $got_rep[0] eq $want_rep[0] ) {
        shift @got_rep;
        shift @want_rep;
    }

    $str = $str->{val};

    for my $spec ( [ 'from', reverse @got_rep ], [ 'to', @want_rep ] ) {
        my $dir = shift @$spec;
        for my $rep ( @$spec ) {
            my $handler = $rep_map{$rep} || croak "Don't know about $rep";
            $str = $handler->{$dir}->( $str );
        }
    }

    return bless {
        val => $str,
        rep => \@desired,
    };
}

=head2 C<< already >>

Declare that a string is already encoded in a particular way. For example:

    my $html = already html => '<p>This is a paragraph</p>';
    my $text =                 'This is just << some text >>';
    
    print literal html => $html;
    # already HTML encoded
    # prints
    #    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    
    print literal html => $text;
    # applies HTML encoding
    # prints
    #   This is just &lt;&lt; some text &gt;&gt;

=cut

sub already($$) {
    return bless {
        val => $_[1],
        rep => [ map { split /_/ } 'ARRAY' eq ref $_[0] ? @$_[0] : $_[0] ]
    };
}

=head2 C<< literal >>

Convert a string to the specified encoding and return it as a normal string.

=cut

sub literal($$) { as( $_[0], $_[1] )->{val} }

=head2 C<< plain >>

Remove any encoding from a string.

    my $uri_enc = already uri => 'Spaces+are+evil%21';
    print plain $uri_enc;
    # prints
    #    Spaces are evil!

=cut

sub plain($) { literal( [], $_[0] ) }

=head2 C<< str_val >>

Get the string representation of a C<String::Smart>. No encoding
coercion takes place; C<str_val> returns a string encoded according to
the current encodings.

=cut

sub str_val($) {
    my $str = $_[0];
    blessed $str && $str->isa( __PACKAGE__ ) ? $str->{val} : $str;
}

=head2 C<< rep >>

Return a list of encodings that currently applies to the specfied
string.

    my $text = 'Just text';
    my @trep = rep $text;   # @trep gets ()
    
    my $html = already html => '<p>Boo!</p>';
    my @hrep = rep $html;   # @hrep gets ( 'html' )

=cut

sub rep {
    my $str = $_[0];
    if ( blessed $str && $str->isa( __PACKAGE__ ) ) {
        my @r = @{ $str->{rep} };
        return wantarray ? @r : join '_', @r;
    }
    return;
}
